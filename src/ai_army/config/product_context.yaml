product_overview: |
  Multi-agent orchestration for GitHub-driven development. Product Crew manages
  backlog and prioritization; Team Lead breaks down features; Dev and QA crews
  implement and merge. All work is tracked via GitHub issues and PRs with
  lifecycle labels.

product_goal: |
  Keep the backlog focused and actionable: at most 8 open issues, clear
  priorities, and issues enriched with acceptance criteria so the rest of the
  pipeline can execute without ambiguity.
